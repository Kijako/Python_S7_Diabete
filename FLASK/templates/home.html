                        US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing
                        patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from
                        the database for encounters that satisfied the following criteria :</p>
                    <ul align="justify">

                        <li>It is a diabetic encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered to the system as a diagnosis</li>
                        <li>The length of stay was at least 1 day and at most 14 days</li>
                        <li>Laboratory tests were performed during the encounter</li>
                        <li>Medications were administered during the encounter</li>

                    <p align="justify"><b>Prediction :</b> This section will allow you to estimate if a patient is at risk of being readmitted to the hospital using the data you have. This data is 
                        then analyzed using a machine learning algorithm that we have trained with the database provided </p>
                    <p align="justify"><b>Result :</b> This page simply provides you with the estimated readmission of the patient based on the parameters entered. </p>
